<div id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Currently a student at WeThinkCode_. Before that, I taught myself Front-End Web Development and built WordPress sites to get my feet into the Tech community. I am not working on school projects, tinkering with some tool to customize my workspace or listening to my favorite podcasts, you can find me reading programming books or scavenging the web for a new tech article to learn from. I have experience working with Python, Java, C, and JavaScript. Right now, I am very interested in DevOps and Backend Development.</p>

        <h3>Wordpress Developer</h3>
        <p id="date">Feb 2021 - Jul 2021</p>
        <p id="company">Holiday Booker</p>
        <p id="responsibility">During this project, I was responsible for the research, designing and implementation of a series of WordPress websites that would create a personal brand for the company. The custom features requested were something that boosted my WordPress skill to a new level. I learned to use plugins, how to use custom CSS to modify elements according to the client's wishes and to transfer themes from one site to another to keep the brand layout consistent. I also dabbled in Adobe Photoshop to edit a series of images to fit the scheme of the website.</p>
