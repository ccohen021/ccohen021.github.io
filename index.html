            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Currently a student at WeThinkCode_. Before that, I taught myself Front-End Web Development and built
                WordPress sites to get my feet into the Tech community. I am not working on school projects, tinkering
                with some tool to customize my workspace or listening to my favorite podcasts, you can find me reading
                programming books or scavenging the web for a new tech article to learn from. I have experience working
                with Python, Java, C, and JavaScript. Right now, I am very interested in DevOps and Backend Development.

                <p class="date">Sep 2022 - Des 2022</p>
                <p class="description">As a Technical Mentor, I served as a support for eight WeThinkCode_ first years.
                    During
                    this
                    time, my
                    responsibilities included technical Support: Helping the mentees understand how to debug, understand
                    errors and troubleshoot problems so that they can become well-rounded developers. Code Support: Reviewing
                    mentee code to provide custom feedback on problem concepts to focus on. I enjoyed this a lot as I got to
                    teach then some common practices on code hygiene. Team-building Skills: I needed to teach them to work together.
                    With this I would host group games and code pairing sessions.
